A very simple browser extension.

To run:
- download SaveMyChat folder
- go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox'
- Load Temporary Add-on
- Select `manifest.json` (or other file)


Once loaded, there will be a blue border on the chatgpt page.

The extension adds a single button to the ChatGPT interface, "Save Conversation". Doing so sends a json file to your browsers' Downloadds location, titled based on the current date.
